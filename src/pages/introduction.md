With Harvest, you have access to most of your Greenhouse data!

The Harvest API was designed to allow our customers to export their data from Greenhouse. However, it can also be used toâ€¦

1. Update candidate information.
2. Add attachments to candidate profiles.
3. Advance, move, and reject applications.

This documentation is open source! Feel free to leave feedback as issues in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/capablemonkey/greenhouse-api-docs) or fork it and contribute changes!

Unless otherwise specified, API methods generally conform to the following:

* Properties without a value will use `null` instead of being undefined
* "Snake Case" is used for attribute names (e.g. first_name)
* Timestamps are rendered in ISO-8601 format (e.g. `2016-02-03T16:38:46.985Z`)
* URLs to external resources are valid for 30 days
* We reserve the right to add more properties to objects, but will never change or remove them
